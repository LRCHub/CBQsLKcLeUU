I'm giving love
You're bringing trouble
You keep me hanging
On your line
I get the feeling
It's getting heavy
The situation got me thinking this ain't right

How could I know
How could I know
But I found out, I was told ...
You got a dirty little secret

I got you creeping thru the shadows
Caught sneaking 'round my door
The gold your spinning is quite deceiving
I get that feeling ... Owwww

How could I know
How could I know
But I found out, I was told ...
You got your dirty little secret

You got your dirty little secret
You got your dirty little secret
You got your dirty little secret

Owwwww

How could I know
How could I know
How could I know
How could I know
But I found out, I was told ... I was told ...
You got your dirty little secret
